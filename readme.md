# `seo-lint`: A Robust SEO Linter / Checker for Local HTML Files

This package offers both a CLI and a library to help you with linting HTML for over 50 common SEO issues.

This SEO tool was spun out of [Elder.js'](https://elderguide.com/tech/elderjs/) plugin called [seo-check](https://github.com/Elderjs/plugins/tree/master/packages/seo-check).

## Tester (Library Usage)

The library exports a `Tester` method which returns an object with 2 methods: `folder` and `test`.

### Recursive Folder Linting: `folder`

If you have a folder of `.html` files you're looking to check for common SEO issues, you just need to specify the folder and seo-lint will recursively check all of the .html files for issues.

```js
const { Tester } = require('./Tester');
const tester = Tester({ siteWide: true, host: 'example.com' });
const results = await tester.folder('public'); // relative to process.cwd()
```

### Raw HTML Linting: `test`

If you have a build process that generates HTML, such as a static site generator, and want to lint that html generated for common SEO issues you can do the following:

```js
const { Tester } = require('./Tester');
const tester = Tester({ host: 'example.com' });
const results = await tester.test(html, relPermalink);

// results will be an object with issues by url and sitewide issues.
```

## CLI

```sh
$ npm i -g  @nickreese/seo-lint
```

**Usage:**

```sh
seo-lint <dir> [options]
```

**Options**

- `-H`, `--host` Set the expected host for internal links. (example.com)
- `-v`, `--version` Displays current version
- `-c`, `--config` Set a custom config to specify rules.
- `-w`, `--write` Location to write a report to a JSON file.

**CLI config**

```js
// const { defaultPreferences, rules } = require('@nickreese/seo-lint');
// available if you want the defaults from the package.
module.exports = {
  rules: [],
  preferences: {},
  writeLocation: `./report.json`, // if this is set it assumes you want the report written.
  display: ['errors', 'warnings'],
};
```

**Advanced Example:**

```sh
$ seo-lint public -H example.com -c seo-lint.config.js -w report.json
```
